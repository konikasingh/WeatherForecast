Weather Forecast Application Development in JavaScript

To complete the Weather Forecast Application Development project, we need to provide clear documentation. This includes:
•	Writing comments within the codebase for better understanding.
•	Creating a README.md file that provides setup instructions, usage guidelines, and other essential details.
________________________________________
Step 1: Commenting the Code (2.5 marks)
We'll add comments to explain the purpose of various functions, event listeners, and key sections in the JavaScript file.
Example of Commenting Code:
javascript
Copy code
// Function to fetch current weather data for a city
// Accepts a city name as a parameter and retrieves weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API
async function getWeatherData(city) {
  const apiKey = 'your_api_key'; // Replace with your actual API key
  const apiUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}&units=metric`;

  try {
    const response = await fetch(apiUrl); // Fetch data from API
    const data = await response.json(); // Parse response as JSON

    // Check if the API request was successful
    if (response.ok) {
      displayWeather(data); // Call function to display weather data
    } else {
      document.getElementById('weatherDetails').textContent = `Error: ${data.message}`; // Display error message
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle network or API failure
    document.getElementById('weatherDetails').textContent = 'Failed to load weather data. Please check your network connection.';
    console.error('Error fetching weather data:', error); // Log error for debugging
  }
}
•	Function headers: Explaining what the function does and what parameters it takes.
•	In-line comments: For important steps in the code, such as handling errors, fetching data, or displaying results.

Step 2: Creating the README.md File (2.5 marks)
We’ll create a README.md file to provide an overview of the project, setup instructions, usage, and any other relevant details.

# Weather Forecast Application

## Description
This is a simple and responsive weather forecast application developed using JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to search for weather forecasts by city or their current location, view current weather conditions, and get a 5-day extended forecast. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

## Features
- Search for weather by city name
- Fetch weather for the current location
- View current temperature, wind speed, and humidity
- 5-day extended forecast
- Recently searched cities dropdown for easy access
- Input validation and error handling

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- You need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.
- A free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/konikasingh/WeatherForecast/tree/main)
2.	Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd weather-forecast-app
3.	Install dependencies (if any):
bash
Copy code
npm install
4.	Replace the placeholder your_api_key with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap in the script.js file:
javascript
Copy code
const apiKey = 'your_api_key'; // Add your API key here
Usage
1.	Open the index.html file in your browser.
2.	Enter a city name or click the "Current Location" button to get the weather forecast.
3.	View the current weather and 5-day forecast.
4.	Recently searched cities will appear in a dropdown for easy access.
